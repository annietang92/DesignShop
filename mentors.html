She develops discovery-based curricula drawn from the current literature to engage undergraduate students in structured, reasonably authentic laboratory and project-based experiences. Dr. Kuldell is the founder and President of The Biobuilder Educational Foundation, a nonprofit organization that takes cutting-edge research projects in synthetic biology and transforms them into teachable modules that students and teachers can investigate together. Started in 2007, BioBuilder was created in response to numerous requests for synthetic biology learning materials from policy makers, environmental groups, and members of the media needing to know more about the basic biology involved, as well as scientists wanting to know more about the engineering aspects of the field. Dr. Kuldell studied Chemistry as an undergraduate at Cornell, completed her doctoral and post-doctoral work at Harvard Medical School, and taught at Wellesley College before joining the faculty at MIT.

      Dr. Kozi&#324;ski has enjoyed a distinguished academic career in
leading institutions in the USA, Europe, and Canada. He is an
internationally-renowned higher education leader, researcher
and entrepreneur, and one of the world&#8217;s most widely
acknowledged experts in sustainable energy systems and immune
building concepts applied to public safety and security.
Educated in Krak&#243;w, Poland, Dr. Kozi&#324;ski subsequently
attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and
spent much of his academic career at McGill University, where
he was Sir William Dawson Scholar and Associate
Vice-Principal (Research and International Relations). <br><br> 

Currently, Dr. Kozi&#324;ski serves as Founding Dean of the
Lassonde School of Engineering at York University, one of the
most ambitious projects in Canadian academia. This $250
million initiative is creating a new Renaissance Engineering&#8482;
program, hiring 100 new faculty and staff, and expanding the
student body by 1500.
Dr. Kozi&#324;ski held the International Chair in Bioenergy at the
Institute for Advanced Studies and the Centre National de la
Recherche Scientifique (France&#8217;s most distinguished research
laboratory) and has completed the prestigious Advanced
Management & Leadership Programme at Oxford University
and the Executive Education Program, Crisis Leadership in
Higher Education, at Harvard University.
Throughout his academic career, Dr. Kozi&#324;ski has organized
and led multi-disciplinary research teams and programs linking
energy, environmental, public health, and security issues. 
        Tying some of these research interests together, Dr. Kozi&#324;ski, as the only invited
scientist from Canada at the time, went into space on a series
of zero-gravity parabolic flights organized by the European
Space Agency.

        Rey Junco is an associate professor of library science at Purdue University and a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. Rey conducts research on how social media influence youth psychosocial development, engagement, and learning. Rey has found that technology, specifically social media like Facebook and Twitter, can be used in ways that improve engagement, academic performance, and persistence. Rey is also interested in examining how social media affect interpersonal relationships, identity development, online discourse, digital inequalities, and how the use of digital media promotes formal and informal learning. As part of his ongoing research program, Rey is exploring the ability to use trace data to provide real-time and unobtrusive prediction of student outcomes. <br><br>
	Rey conducted the first large, multi-institution survey of student technology use and reported the results in a book he coauthored with Jeanna Mastrodicasa, entitled <i>Connecting to the Net.Generation: What Higher Education Professionals Need to Know about Today&#8217;s Students</i>. In his second book, <i>Using Emerging Technologies to Enhance Student Engagement</i>, he and his colleagues provided a comprehensive analysis of social media&#8217;s role in student engagement, technology&#8217;s potential to improve retention, and blogs&#8217; potential to improve students&rsquo; writing and marketing skills. His empirical work has been published in high-impact journals such as Computers & Education, Computers in Human Behavior, and the Journal of Computer Assisted Learning. 
        Rey has given talks, workshops, and lectures at over 50 national and international conferences, universities, and organizations. He enjoys talking about how technology impacts colleges students, using social media in educationally-relevant ways, teaching students about privacy, marketing university programs and services through social media, and developing effective first year seminars.

      Steve Chinosi is an architect of experience and the Chief Innovation Officer of Newton Public Schools. He&#8217;s spent the last 20 years guiding students up mountains, down rivers, across Shakespeare, and beyond biodiesel.
Curriculum innovation drives the core of Steve&#8217;s instructional practice.  He started his teaching career as a mountain guide and spent his first ten years in a classroom translating all he learned as a guide into his literature classes. 
Curiously, it was students in his English class that inspired him to develop the award-winning, internationally recognized &ldquo;Greengineers.&rdquo; The program is a design lab on a mission. It’s also a collaborative STEAM think-tank (formerly known as a &lsquo;class&rsquo;) that integrates Art, Chemistry, Engineering, Physics, Economics, Finance, Design, and Industrial Safety. The curriculum innovation hinges on the creation of environments that support &ldquo;Solution-Centered Learning with Student-Centered Solutions.&rdquo; Currently, the Greengineers support similar programs in schools across North America and the world. <br><br>
The success of the Greengineers led to the creation of the Office of Ingenuity, an educational design lab.  The Office of Ingenuity gathers community expertise with the curiosity of the best students and most innovative faculty. The Office of Ingenuity is a conceptual and physical space designed to re-imagine, explore, and create ecosystems of opportunity for schools and the communities they serve.
