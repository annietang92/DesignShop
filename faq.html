            * No previous experience with design thinking required, but you are strongly encouraged to keep an open mind. <br>
            * And yes, in case it wasn't clear, there's prototyping involved. That means learning to visualize your ideas through commonly found materials like foam core, blue foam, wood, hot glue, straws, logos, and other fun toys!

            Design thinking is a human - centered approach to innovation that draw's from a designer's toolkit.<br><br>
            Design thinking is a set of steps to help generate innovative solutions to problems. (Design thinking can be represented as a procedure, or a verb. This is an oversimplification, but it is a very useful simplification. All definitions are wrong, but some are useful.)<br><br>
            Design thinking is a tool. It can be used, and it can be misused. Use it as appropriate, but also as necessary.<br><br>
            Design thinking is also notoriously hard to define :)<br><br>
            You will find almost as many definitions as there are design thinkers in the world. That's OK! Design thinking is biased towards procedure and action, but shall always be a reflection of users' and designers' needs. The general IDEO driven design thinking linear flow is a good starting point, but should not be taken for any silver bullet in the real world.<br><br>
            Final note, hotshot: "design thinking" should not be capitalized. It's not a lofty philosophy or a rigid copyrighted framework. It's an approach with many faces. The term just does not want to be capitalized.

            Have you heard of learning by doing? This is it. We want to actually produce viable ideas and interesting project in a diverse team based environment. It is a rewarding experience that bears sweet fruit, but it does take time. There is no way around it. Two days are the absolute minimum (and it's already a bit of a compromise :)<br><br>
            We could explain to how to use design thinking in twenty minutes to you, but you would not be able to go through the process without us once we part. Moreover, even if you were able to use design thinking yourself after 20 minutes (let's assume you have learning superpowers), you simply would not use it. Humans generally need to actually engage in the activity to truly learn.
